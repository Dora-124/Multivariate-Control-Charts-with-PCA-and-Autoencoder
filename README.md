# Multivariate-Control-Charts-with-PCA-and-Autoencoder

This project was developed in the context of the course Statistical Quality Control (NTUA) and focuses on multivariate statistical process monitoring using:

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

- Autoencoders (Neural Networks)

The objective is the detection of process faults through multivariate control charts and comparison of linear and nonlinear monitoring techniques.

The experimental evaluation is performed using the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP) dataset, a benchmark dataset widely used in process monitoring research.
